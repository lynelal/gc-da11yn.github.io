			<p><p>This document provides an overview of the requirements we plan to include in phase one of the <em><a href='../standard'>Standard on Information and Communication Technology Accessibility (<abbr>ICT</abbr>)</a></em>.</p> <p>It provides background information, explanations of each requirement and some publicly available resources.</p></p>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is important to note the information in this document is for reference purposes only and <strong>must not be interpreted as being official standard guidance</strong>. Official standard guidance will be published at a later date and will provide detailed information on how departments can satisfy each standard requirement.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>One in six people in Canada has a disability. Accessible information and communication technology ensures that people with disabilities can access and use Government of Canada services without barriers. Making services accessible to people with disabilities makes them accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, the Government of Canada has an obligation to make sure the next generation of technological solutions are developed with accessibility at their core so that no one is left behind.</p>
<p>The release of the <em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/">Accessible Canada Act</a></em>, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc/accessibility-strategy-public-service-technology.html">Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service of Canada</a> and the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32620">Guideline for Making Information Technology Usable for All</a> in 2019 led to many initiatives across the Government of Canada to make <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> barrier-free. One of these initiatives was the drafting of the <em>Standard on Information and Communication Technology Accessibility</em>. This standard, which will replace the <em>Standard on Web Accessibility</em>, will expand the scope of accessibility requirements under the <em>Policy on Service and Digital</em>. The standard will be harmonized with the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>Harmonised European Standard on Accessibility Requirements for <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> Products and Services (2021) (EN 301 549)</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> to: meet all relevant requirements in the act and strategy; align with international best practices; and align with <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> (2021 and future updates).</p>
<h2>About the standard</h2>
<p>The standard contains requirements for:</p>
<ul>
<li>procurement of information and communication technology goods and services</li>
<li>web content</li>
<li>non-web documents</li>
<li>enterprise and departmental software</li>
<li>native mobile applications</li>
<li>hardware</li>
<li>user feedback</li>
<li>workforce capacity and capabilities</li>
<li>planning and performance reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>An accompanying scorecard and maturity model are being developed for departments to use to assess their progress towards achieving the goal of making <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> usable by all.</p>
<p>In November 2021, the Office of the Chief Information Officer conducted government‑wide consultations on the draft standard and on an accessibility measurement Scorecard. The consultations revealed that departments thought they lacked the resources and technical expertise to implement the standard in full.</p>
<p>To make sure all new <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> used in the federal government is accessible, and to give departments time to make existing technology accessible, we are publishing the standard in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1</strong> contains requirements that are relatively low cost and low risk to implement</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2</strong> contains requirements that are more expensive and more difficult to implement</li>
</ul>

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>After we publish Phase 1 of the standard, all new web content (public-facing <strong>and</strong> internal web) will have to be accessible and satisfy the clauses in <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a>.</p>
<p>Departments will have to include an accessibility statement with all new web content. This statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the content. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the level of accessibility of the website (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG 2.1</a> assessment criteria)</li>
<li>any parts of the site that are not accessible</li>
<li>what your organization has done to make sure the site is accessible</li>
<li>contact information for where users can report accessibility problems</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.</p>
<h3>Existing public-facing content: conformance testing</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to first assess their existing public-facing web content. Departments can use a combination of manual and automated tools to assess their existing public-facing web content. They can also have users test it. If a department doesn’t have access to internal testers, it can hire third-party testers.</p>
<h3>Existing public-facing content: accessibility statement and feedback mechanism</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>

    <tr>
      <td>2.1.2.3</td>
      <td>All existing public-facing web pages must feature an accessibility statement and a user feedback mechanism;</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Public-facing web content includes material on Canada.ca and material on departmental websites.</p>
<p>Before departments assess their existing public-facing web content, they will have to provide a mechanism that lets users provide feedback on the site they are visiting. Feedback can include broken links, spelling or grammar errors, and problems with accessibility. An example of a user feedback mechanism is the one on Canada.ca.</p>
<p>Departments will have to include an accessibility statement on all their existing public-facing web content. The accessibility statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the web content being on the web page. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the level of accessibility of the web page (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG 2.1</a> assessment criteria)</li>
<li>any parts of the web page that are not accessible</li>
<li>what your organization has done to make sure the web page is accessible</li>
<li>contact information on the web page where users can request assistance navigating the web page and accessing the web content</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.</p>
<h3>Existing internal-facing content: conformance testing</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.2.4</td>
      <td>Accessibility conformance testing against the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> standard must be conducted for all existing internal-facing web content used by the department</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard + 24 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Internal‑facing web content is material that is posted on pages that can’t be accessed from outside the Government of Canada (for example, departmental intranet pages). Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to first assess their existing internal-facing web content. Departments can assess their existing internal-facing websites with a combination of manual and automated assessment tools and with user testing. Hiring of third-party accessibility conformance testers is also an option should the department not have access to internal GC testers.</p>
<h2>Non-web documents</h2>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.3.1</td>
      <td>Departments must provide an accessible version of any non-web document when requested</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Non-web documents can include Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint slides, Excel spreadsheets and PDF files.</p>
<p>When a member of the public or a Government of Canada employee requests an accessible version of a non-web document, the department will be required to provide one. Departments should therefore, whenever possible, create non-web documents in an accessible format.</p>
<h2>Enterprise and departmental software</h2>
<h3>New enterprise and departmental software: compliance, accessibility statement</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>

<p>Following the publication of the Standard on <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> Accessibility (Phase 1), all new enterprise and departmental software will need to satisfy the clauses in <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a></p>
<p>Departments will have to include an accessibility statement with all new enterprise and departmental software. This statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the software being used. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the level of accessibility of the software application (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG 2.1</a> assessment criteria)</li>
<li>any parts of the software that are not accessible</li>
<li>what your organization has done to make sure the software is accessible</li>
<li>contact information for where users can report accessibility problems</li>

<p>After Phase 1 of the standard takes effect, all new native mobile applications will need to satisfy the applicable clauses in <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a>.</p>
<p>Departments will have to include an accessibility statement with all new native mobile applications. This statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the mobile application. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the level of accessibility of the mobile application (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN 301 549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG 2.1</a> assessment criteria)</li>
<li>any parts of the mobile application that are not accessible</li>
<li>what your organization has done to make sure the mobile application is accessible</li>
<li>contact information for where users can report accessibility problems</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.</p>

<p>Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to assess their existing native mobile apps. Departments can assess their existing native mobile applications with a combination of manual and automated assessment tools and with user testing. Hiring of third-party accessibility conformance testers is also an option should the department not have access to internal GC testers.</p>

<p>Hardware includes keyboards, computer mice, and stationary <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>. Any feature that improves accessibility (i.e., text-to-speech, closed-captioning, and keyboard shortcuts, etc.) on any new hardware will need to be made available to all users from the outset.</p>
<p>When implementing built-in accessibility features, under subsection B.2.6 of the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611">Mandatory Procedures for Information Technology Security Control</a>, deputy heads must “implement IT security assessment and authorization processes to establish and maintain confidence in the security of information systems that are used or managed by the department, while considering stakeholder security requirements.”</p>

<p>Accessibility benefits everyone and its implementation is all our responsibility. Departments are responsible for making sure that learning opportunities are provided to their staff, such as training about accessibility, intersectionality, and unconscious bias.</p>
<p>Training and awareness-raising events through the Canada School of Public Service and the Federal Speakers’ Bureau on Healthy Workplaces, among other venues, can be developed to combat myths and remove stigma of disability.</p>
<p>This requirement also aligns with the <em>Policy on Service and Digital</em>’s requirement for departments to provide internal activities by requiring that these learning opportunities be available to all employees.</p>

<p>According to the <em><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603">Policy on Service and Digital</a></em>, deputy heads are responsible for approving a three‑year departmental plan for service and digital. This plan “establishes the strategic direction for the integrated management of service, information, data, IT, and cyber security” (subsection 4.1.2.7 of the policy). In support of this responsibility, departments must submit their plan for service and digital to TBS. In their next plan for service and digital, departments will be required to include a hyperlink to their accessibility plans.</p>
